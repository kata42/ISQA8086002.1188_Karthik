# Background Research on the Phenemenon




##  Phenology:
Phenology is the study of plant life cycle events influenced by climate and habitat factors such as elevation, Fauna, etc. _(wiki/Phenology, n.d.)_. Phenology Influences organisms in our case plants. Temperature and precipitation affect the phenology of plants. How plants and animals respond to the climate change can help us predict whether their populations will grow or shrink making phenology a “leading indicator” of climate change impacts. _(why-phenology, n.d.)_

## Applications of Phenology: 
* Management of invasive species and forest pests
* Predictions of human health-related events, such as allergies and mosquito season
* Optimization of when to plant, fertilize, and harvest crops
* Understanding the timing of ecosystem processes, such as carbon cycling
* Assessment of the vulnerability of species, populations, and ecological communities to ongoing climate change.  _(why-phenology, n.d.)_

## Plant PhenoPhases:
In case of flowering plants, the life cycle events are called Phenophases. Phenophase include
* Leaf budburst
* First full leaf (first leaf is fully expanded)
* Entire plant leaf-out (all leaves on the plant are expanded)
* First flower
* Peak flowering (largest floral display)
* Last flower
* Fruit maturity and seed dispersal
* Leaf senescence (color change and abscission — the process of losing leaves at the end of the growing season.  _(Mazer, 2008)_

## Stakeholders of Phenology:
* Farmers: recording the growth of their crops
* Fire fighters: Concerned about the build up of fuel that affects summer.
* Physicians: Interested in predicting the intensity of allergy seasons.
* Ecologists: Who monitor rodents carrying diseases.
* Park Rangers: Who monitor the health of forests.  _(Mazer, 2008)_

## Phenological Monitoring: 

The goal of the phenological studies is to obtain the precise key life cycle events. But there are substantial variations among the species in how they complete a given phenophase.
A few points to be kept in check for phenological monitoring are

* **Consistency and accuracy**
To have success in phenological monitoring consistent observations and accurate identifications of phenophases are needed. Especially when the monitoring is carried out among hundreds of observers in the phenology network.

* **Where to Do Phenological Monitoring**
Phenological monitoring can be done anywhere, like neighborhood, roadways, bike paths etc. But to collect accurate data then the location must be chosen on certain factors like the convenience and access to the site, the permanence of the habitat, the influence of human activity.

* **When to Do Phenological Monitoring**
The spring and autumn are particularly rewarding periods because the biosphere changes so quickly.

* **Which Plant Species to Monitor**
This is generally based on two decisions, Community based decision and phenology-based decision.
Community based decision is based on the habitat of the region and which are the dominant native plant species.
In Phenology based decision species of plants are chosen based on their seasonal phenology. _(Mazer, 2008)_



## Climate Change and Phenology:
Climate change is playing an important role in affecting the phenology of the plants. The intensity of the seasons is varying across the globe. The winters are much shorter than before leading to an early spring season and rise in spring temperatures.
The geographic response to the climate change has resulted in some species of plants are being replaced by other plant species who grow faster in warmer weathers.
Lastly, food webs within ecological communities are likely to change when novel species colonize a habitat, potentially disrupting resource availability for many members of the community. For example, as the number and abundances of different species in an area change as species move in and out in response to climate change, the number and types of species competing for the same foods can increase. _(Mazer, 2008)_.

## Earlier Leaf Out Times and Their effects:

Species that leaf out the earliest are in greater danger of having their young leaves damaged by a late frost, which can stunt growth instead. Recent experiments suggest that the members of the rose family have greater degree of frost tolerance in their young leaves than the species that leaf out later. Therefore, the effect of the frost damage varies from species to species locally available in a region.
Late frost has more impact on the fruit trees when compared trees that bloom flowers. Frost damage in apple and cherry trees can lead to failure of crops. One such event occurred in northern USA in 2012, wiping out cherry and apples crops in Michigan.
If the late frost can damage the fruits, the migratory birds which depend on these fruits for their survival would also be affected, thereby creating a ripple effect in the ecology of the system. _(RICHARD B. PRIMACK, 2016)_

## Phenology Network:
The goal of forming a phenology network was to train and coordinate a group of people to monitor simultaneously phenological events across a wide geographic area and share the information.
Over the last several years, representatives from the International Society of Biometeorology Phenology Commission (ISB-PC) and the World Meteorological Organization Commission for Agricultural Meteorology (WMO-CAgM) have been discussing the concept of a "Global Alliance of Phenological Observation Networks" (GAPON). _(partner/gapon, n.d.)_
Phenology study can also be used to check the changes at the genetic level, since phenological events among the plant populations collected is too huge to conclude, scientists have been carrying out the research on smaller plantations or gardens. _(Mazer, 2008)_

## Species Involved in the Research:
* **Prunus serotine (black cherry):** 
  Prunus serotina, commonly called black cherry, wild black cherry, rum cherry, or mountain black cherry, is a deciduous woody plant       species belonging to the genus Prunus. The species is widespread and common in North America and South America._(wiki/Prunus_serotina, n.d.)_

* **Corylus Americana (American hazelnut):**
Corylus americana, the American hazelnut or American hazel, is a species of deciduous shrub in the genus Corylus, native to the eastern and central United States and extreme southern parts of eastern and central Canada._(wiki/Corylus_americana, n.d.)_

* **Prunus maritima (Beach plum):**
Prunus maritima, the beach plum, is a species of plum native to the East Coast of the United States, from Maine south to Maryland. Although sometimes listed as extending to New Brunswick, the species is not known from collections there, and does not appear in the most authoritative works on the flora of that Canadian province. _(wiki/Prunus_maritima, n.d.)_

* **Gaylussacia baccata (black huckleberry):** 
Gaylussacia baccata, the black huckleberry, is a common huckleberry found throughout a wide area of eastern North America._(wiki/Gaylussacia_baccata, n.d.)_

* **Morella pensylvanica (northern bayberry):**
Myrica pensylvanica, the northern bayberry, is a species of Myrica native to eastern North America, from Newfoundland west to Ontario and Ohio, and south to North Carolina. It is also classified as Morella pensylvanica. _(wiki/Myrica_pensylvanica, n.d.)_

* **Quercus ilicifolia (bear oak):** 
Quercus ilicifolia, commonly known as bear oak or scrub oak, is a small shrubby oak native to the eastern United States and southeastern Canada. Its range extends in the United States from Maine to North Carolina, with reports of a few populations north of the international frontier in Ontario. The name ilicifolia means "holly-leaved." _(wiki/Quercus_ilicifolia, n.d.)_

* **Vaccinium angustifolium (lowbush blueberry):** 
Vaccinium angustifolium, commonly known as the wild lowbush blueberry, is a species of blueberry native to eastern and central Canada (from Manitoba to Newfoundland) and the northeastern United States, growing as far south as the Great Smoky Mountains and west to the Great Lakes region. _(wiki/Vaccinium_angustifolium, n.d.)_
